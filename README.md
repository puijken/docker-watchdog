🐋 Docker Watchdog — Auto-Start & Auto-Stop Container Manager

A lightweight Flask + Shell-based “watchdog” that automatically starts, monitors, and stops Docker containers based on user activity.
Designed to work seamlessly behind Traefik (or any reverse proxy), this container ensures your heavy apps only run when they’re actually in use.
